## Description
This project is a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where a human player can play against an AI opponent. The AI uses various search algorithms to determine its moves, making the game challenging and fun. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built using Tkinter for an interactive experience.
- **Multiple AI Strategies**: The AI uses different search algorithms to play:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Depth-Limited Search (DLS)
  - Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)
  - Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)
- **Reset Functionality**: Easily restart the game at any time.
- **Customizable Difficulty**: Choose between different AI strategies for varying levels of difficulty.

## Algorithms Implemented
The following search algorithms are implemented in the AI:
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all possible moves level by level.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores moves along a branch before backtracking.
3. **Depth-Limited Search (DLS)**: Limits the depth of the search to avoid infinite loops.
4. **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**: Combines the benefits of BFS and DFS by iteratively increasing the depth limit.
5. **Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)**: Prioritizes moves based on a cost function.

## How to Run
Follow these steps to run the game on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abodzza/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI.git
